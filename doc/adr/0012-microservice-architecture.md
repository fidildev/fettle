# 12. microservice-architecture

Date: 2022-11-28

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need an architecture for building fettle

## Decision

We will be utilizing a microservice architecture to use as an example of how to build a distributed system.

## Consequences

In real life we probably wouldn't start with microservices for something like this. But in order to showcase our patterns it makes the most sense.
