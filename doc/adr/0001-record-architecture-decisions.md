# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2022-11-19

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.
com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions). 

These ADRs will be managed using [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools).

## Consequences

ADRs will allow us to know the history of our decisions, and adr-tools will allow us to manage our ADRs easily.
