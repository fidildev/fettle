# 5. github actions

Date: 2022-11-25

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a CI/CD pipeline tool to ensure we can implement continuous deliver effectively.

## Decision

We will use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for CI/CD pipelines.

## Consequences

We will have a standardized CI/CD pipeline tool that is rich in components (like Helm) we can reuse to easily build 
pipelines.
