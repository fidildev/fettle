## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a way to authenticate and authorize users as well as make API calls to GitHub.

## Decision

We will leverage [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) as it has the ability integrate with GitHub authentication, via a [GitHub OAuth App](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps). This is what Auth0 calls [Social Login](https://auth0.com/learn/social-login).

## Consequences

There will be two tokens the application needs. The first one is required to make calls against our application. This JWT is produced by Auth0 and will contain user permissions. The benefit is that our services won't have to make any calls to gather permissions. The second token is required to communicate with GitHub. We get this token from Auth0 via their [Third-Party Access Token](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/access-tokens/identity-provider-access-tokens) mechanism.
